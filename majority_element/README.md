# Majority Element in Python3 

### Overview:

* majority_element 
* Data Structures and Algorithms 

### Purpose:

* write a majority_element algorithm using recursive divide and conquer
* The Majority Element
* Given a list of integer values, the a majority element exist if it occurs 
greater than 50% of the time. 

### Eg. 

* Given the 5 element list: 1 2 2 2 7 
* A majority element exists, and it is "2" 

### Input:

* a series of integer numbers, where n >= 0
* 2 lines of input are taken from STDIN 
* First line: a single integer indicating the number of elements in the second line
* Second line: the N number of elements that will be searched to determine if a majority 
elemnt exists

### Output: 

* 1 for majority element exists
* 0 for majority element DOES NOT exist

### Constraints: 

* element in the list: 1 <= element <= 10**9
* input is sorted for (a) 

### Usage:

* python3 majority_element
* 5 
* 1 2 2 2 7 
* 1 

### Testing:

* unit test for this code can be found in: test_majority_element.py
* Test usage:
* pthon3 test_majoriity_element -v
