## Sort list of integers

## Description:

- basic python program to show sorting a list of number pairs

- Given a list of integer number pairs that will come from STDIN
- first read in n, the number of lines of input containing input pairs
- then for 1 to n, read in each integer number pair into a list like structure
with each number pair also in a list
- this will create a list whose elements are lists, that contains integer number pairs

E.g.: [ [1,10], [7,70], [2,20], [4, 40] ]

- Once read, sort the list based on the first or second list-pair elelment

## E.g. input
3

1 10

7 70

2 20

4 40  

## Output: 
- the sorted list of list pairs

E.g. [['1', '10'], ['2', '20'], ['4', '40'], ['7', '70']]
 
## Constraints:
- the program does not do input validation
